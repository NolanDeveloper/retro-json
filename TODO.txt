* In parser and in all procedures working with Objects recurstion depth must be limited.
* Implement json object as hashmap with linear probing.
    * Implement removing elements
* Add as much documentation as possible
* Add cool readme
* Parser should be more inclusive. e.g. parse trailing comma
* Add proper error handling with to pretty printer
* Implement precomputation of sizes for all json nodes: strings, arrays, objects; as memory their growth takes
  a lot of time during parsing and doesn't do well with cache locality.
  Parsing may be done in two passes. The first one collects sizes of all structures. The second one builds json nodes.
